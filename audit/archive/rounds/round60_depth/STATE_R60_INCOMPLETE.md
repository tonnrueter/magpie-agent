# magpie R60 — INCOMPLETE. Not a measurement.

**Status: HALTED mid-run on a monthly spend limit, 2026-08-02.** 27 of 60 agents completed;
33 failed with `You've hit your monthly spend limit`. **No number in this round may be
quoted as a result.** The pre-registered decision rules in
`audit/corpus_investigation_plan.md` are **all UNDECIDED** — see *What cannot be answered*.

## What ran

| Audit lenses (report written to disk) | **21** | 45 |
| Verify (adversarial refutation) | **0** | 9 |
| Measure | **0** | 1 |

> **UPDATE 2026-08-02 morning — this document was written before `module_34` completed.**
> The "within-module arm entirely missing" statement below is superseded: `module_34` now
> has full lens coverage AND a refuter verdict, making it the round's first — and the
> project's only — clean within-module measurement. The arm is 1 of 3 docs, not 0 of 3.

## ⚠️ The returned matrix is invalid, in two independent ways

**1. `Critical: 0` and `Major: 0` in every cell is an ARTIFACT, not a finding.**
`isConfirmed()` requires a Critical/Major to carry a surviving refuter verdict. Zero
refuters ran, so `verdictByBug[b.id]` was undefined for all of them and **122 Critical/Major
findings were silently zeroed**. A reader glancing at the matrix would conclude the
`cross_module/` docs contain no serious defects. The opposite is closer to true.

**2. Full denominator, partial numerator.** Ledgers are cheap and run first, so all 9
returned (1,949 claims). Findings came from 18 of 45 lenses. Every rate off the pooled
matrix is therefore biased **downward** by construction.

Both are now guarded: the workflow counts `crit_major_dropped_unadjudicated` explicitly and
emits a `validity` block with `reportable:false` plus a warning, and the measure agent is
instructed to return UNDECIDED unless every criterion can be evaluated on fully covered docs
alone. Verified by replaying this round's exact completion pattern (refuses) against a
complete run (passes).

## What the salvageable part shows — LEAD ONLY, below the confirmation bar

The 3 docs with complete structured coverage, **476 claims**:

```
raw findings                 201
after prose-key dedup        170
after code-fact dedup         98   <- distinct defects
                            ----
distinct / claims          98/476 = 20.6%   95% CI [17.2%, 24.4%]

Critical      13 raw ->  7 distinct
Crit+Major   122 raw -> 59 distinct
```

**Why this is not a result:** zero adversarial refutation ran. This project's bar is
refuted-survived; R58's refuters left 46 of 47 findings standing but moved several
severities *down*, so the Critical/Major split is precisely the least reliable part of an
unrefuted tally. Treat 20.6% as an upper envelope on 3 docs, not a density.

**Why it is still worth recording:** R55 measured 5.6% on 3 module hubs. Even if refutation
halved this, `cross_module/` would sit well above — the direction Sprint X predicted. And 7
distinct Criticals on 3 docs against R55's 1 on 3 docs is a large gap. A lead to test, not a
finding to cite.

**The dedup earned its keep on first contact:** 201 → 98 is 2.05x. Without it this round
would have reported ~42%.

**Selection caveat:** the 3 complete docs are simply the first 3 in the dispatch array — they
finished before the limit hit. Arrival order, not a doc property, but not random either.

## `module_34` — the one complete, refuted result (2026-08-02, commit 6f446ba)

Within-module arm, drawn at random (seed 60), and the **coldest doc in the corpus** — 2 prior
round records, never depth-audited. `validity.reportable: true`, 5/5 lenses, refuter ran.

```
claims                    114
findings (prose key)       37   32.5%  95% CI [24.6%, 41.5%]
distinct (code-fact)       22   19.3%  95% CI [13.1%, 27.5%]
Critical 6   Major 13   fully refuted 0   CORRECTED 8
classes: other 7, mechanism 7, attribution_* 11, set_membership 4, citation 4
```

**This is the gradient's third point, and it is the one that matters:**

```
R55  3 MOST-audited hubs      498 claims   5.6%    1 Critical
R58  3 stale hubs             595 claims   7.7%    7 Criticals
R60  module_34, never audited 114 claims  19-32%   6 Criticals
```

Audit ATTENTION drives measured residual down, so a hub result is a **floor**, not a ceiling.
Caveats that must travel: n=1 doc; as the coldest doc this is plausibly a within-module upper
bound; and the refuter CORRECTED 8 of 19 Critical/Major rather than upholding them as
written, so the severity mix is softer than the raw counts suggest.

## 2026-08-02 evening — `carbon_balance_conservation` measured (adversarial refutation ran)

⚠️ This section was first headed "✅ ANSWERED". **The locus question is NOT answered** — see
the power correction below. What IS answered: both arms now have a refuted measurement.

`validity.reportable: true`, 5/5 lenses, refuter 1/1, `crit_major_dropped_unadjudicated: 0`.
210 claims, 67 prose-key / **43 distinct code facts**, 3 Critical, 18 Major, 0 fully refuted,
5 CORRECTED.

```
                                   claims  prose-key         code-fact
cross_module  carbon_balance         210   31.9%   43   20.5%  CI [15.6, 26.4]
within-module module_34              114   32.5%   22   19.3%  CI [13.1, 27.5]
                                   Fisher exact, code-fact:  p = 0.885
```

**NO DIFFERENCE DETECTED — but the comparison is UNDERPOWERED, so this is UNDECIDED, not a
refutation.** (Corrected second pass, 2026-08-02.) Power at n=210 vs n=114 is 17% for a
5-point true difference, 51% for 10 points, 83% only at 15. My own pre-registered rule says a
straddling interval is recorded as UNDECIDED with the n that would decide it: **~290 claims
per arm** for a 10-point effect. The locus hypothesis is not refuted; it is untested at
adequate power. The re-target onto CLASS is still the right move, but it rests on the class
evidence below, NOT on this comparison.

⚠️ **PER-CLASS RATES FROM R60 ARE INVALID — retracted 2026-08-02.** The Enumerate agent
classifies CLAIMS into classes and the lens agents classify DEFECTS into classes, and the two
allocations disagree (cells include 8 citation defects / 2 citation claims). Pooled rates and
severity COUNTS are sound; the per-class split is not. Any "N/M = X%" per class published
from this round is withdrawn.

**The class signal, as COUNTS, from an instrument that shares no code with the other two:**
**All 3 of `carbon_balance`'s Criticals are `attribution_read`**, and 3 of `module_34`'s 6
Criticals sit in mechanizable classes. Those are COUNTS from the refuted findings and are
sound. Alongside R55 (attribution_read was its highest class and carried its only Critical)
and arena 1A (`attribution_role` 28.1% vs 4.2%, p=0.0012 — computed from hand-labelled traps,
so unaffected by the denominator defect above), that is three independent instruments
pointing at the same class. **The direction is supported; no percentage from R60's per-class
split is.**

> ⚠️ **DOWNGRADED 2026-08-02, second-reader review — the paragraph above overstates twice.**
> (1) The arena's p=0.0012 is an answer-level Fisher, but class varies only BETWEEN traps:
> the attribution class is exactly 2 of 8 traps (T5, T6 — both seeded from the same commit
> `ec119a9`, authored after R55 flagged the class). At the trap level the permutation test
> gives **p = 0.036** (`audit/tools/second_reader_reanalysis_2026_08_02.py`), and with 2
> traps per class, "the class propagates" and "these two items are hard" are unidentifiable.

**What predicts density is PRIOR AUDIT EXPOSURE.** Two docs of different kinds, both never
depth-audited, land 0.6 points apart (31.9% / 32.5%) and 4-6x above the audited hubs (R55
5.6%, R58 7.7%).

## Still open

- `module_35`, `module_56`, and the remaining cross_module docs are unaudited. They would
  narrow the intervals but are unlikely to change the direction, which is now consistent
  across four docs and three instruments.
- Both new guards proved out on live data: the per-doc-set `MEASUREMENT_<slug>.md` filename
  (no collision) and `_checkpoint_audits.json` (25 KB, 67 bugs, written BEFORE Verify).

## Recovery, when budget allows

1. `water_balance_conservation` has **5/5 complete reports on disk**; 3 failed only on the
   structured return. Those findings are recoverable without re-running the agents, but they
   are prose and must not be hand-merged into a structured tally — different substrate.
2. Re-run with the same args. The 3 complete docs plus 9 ledgers replay from cache
   (`resumeFromRunId: wf_5e1dec91-4bf` **plus the full args payload** — a resume does NOT
   restore args; that is what voided the 03:23 attempt).
3. The refutation phase is the priority: without it nothing here clears the bar.

## Also in this directory

`MEASUREMENT_VOID_2026-08-02.md` — output of the **earlier void run** (zero docs audited, an
all-zero matrix from an argless invocation). Kept as evidence of that failure mode. Its
corpus-Criticals extrapolation is built entirely on inherited numerators and **must not be
cited**; its diagnosis of the void, which it got right and refused to paper over, is the
part worth reading.
