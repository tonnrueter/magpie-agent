# Corpus investigation — master plan, priority-ordered

# ⏸ READ FIRST — state at 2026-08-02, and the open strategic decision

**R60 ran partially and is HALTED on a monthly spend limit.** Full state:
`audit/archive/rounds/round60_depth/STATE_R60_INCOMPLETE.md`. One doc completed and was
adversarially refuted (`module_34`); the cross_module side has 476 claims and 98 distinct
findings but **no refutation**, so it is below this project's bar.

## THE LOCUS COMPARISON: no difference detected — but UNDERPOWERED, not refuted

> **CORRECTED 2026-08-02, second pass.** This section first read "THE LOCUS HYPOTHESIS IS
> REFUTED". That overstates it, and my own pre-registered rule says so: *"a rule fires only
> if the 95% interval excludes the threshold; a straddle is recorded as UNDECIDED at this n."*
> The intervals here exclude nothing. Computed power at n=210 vs n=114:
>
> ```
> true difference          power to detect it
> 19% vs 24%  (5 pts)             17%
> 19% vs 29%  (10 pts)            51%
> 19% vs 34%  (15 pts)            83%
> ```
>
> The study could only have caught a LARGE effect. The supported claim is **"no difference
> detected, at low power"**; the locus hypothesis is **NOT refuted**, it is **UNDECIDED** —
> and deciding it needs roughly n≈290 claims per arm for a 10-point effect.
>
> Note what failed here: the pre-registration was followed, but the pre-registered rule had
> **no power clause**, so following it faithfully still produced an overstatement.
> Pre-registration protects against post-hoc rationalisation; it does not protect against an
> underpowered design. Add a power requirement to any future comparison rule.

**Both arms are now measured with the same instrument, adversarially refuted, against the
corrected role map** (`validity.reportable: true` on both, zero unadjudicated drops):

```
                                   claims  prose-key         code-fact
cross_module  carbon_balance_conservation   210   31.9%   43   20.5%  CI [15.6, 26.4]
within-module module_34                     114   32.5%   22   19.3%  CI [13.1, 27.5]
                                   Fisher exact on code-fact rate:  p = 0.885
```

**They are indistinguishable.** Sprint X's central premise — that defects concentrate in
cross-module claims — **does not hold.** This fires the pre-registered rule verbatim:
*"Cross-module ≈ within-module → the locus hypothesis is wrong, and that is a real result
worth recording; re-target on CLASS (attribution_role) instead of locus."*

**Re-targeting on class is now backed by three instruments that share no code:**

```
R55           attribution_read   9/38  = 23.7%   (highest class; carried the round's only Critical)
Arena 1A      attribution_role   28.1% vs 4.2% all other classes   p = 0.0012
R60 carbon    ALL 3 Criticals are attribution_read      (COUNT, not a rate -- see below)
R60 module_34 3 of 6 Criticals are in mechanizable classes
```

> ⚠️ **DOWNGRADED 2026-08-02 (second-reader review).** The arena line is a unit-of-analysis
> error: class varies only BETWEEN traps (2 of 8 — T5/T6, both seeded from commit `ec119a9`,
> authored after R55 flagged the class), so the honest test is trap-level: **p = 0.036**, not
> 0.0012 (`audit/tools/second_reader_reanalysis_2026_08_02.py`; class-vs-item unidentifiable
> at 2 traps/class). "Three instruments that share no code" also overstates *independence*:
> the traps were authored to probe R55's hypothesis, by the same person. And the omitted
> counter-instance: **R58's 7 Criticals sat in prose synthesis with all 27 module
> attributions correct** (round 58 `structural_finding`) — the class concentration does not
> hold in maintained docs. Direction still plausible for cold docs; not established.

⚠️ **RETRACTED 2026-08-02: the "attribution_read 11/19 = 58%" figure first published here was
invalid, and NO per-class rate may be quoted from R60.** The Enumerate agent classifies
CLAIMS into classes; the lens agents classify DEFECTS into classes; **the two allocations do
not agree.** R60 per-class cells include `citation 8 defects / 2 claims` and
`attribution_read 4 defects / 1 claim` — rates above 100%, which is proof of misallocation,
not of density. The per-class denominators sum correctly to `total_checkable` (210), so the
POOLED rate is sound and the SEVERITY COUNTS are sound; only the per-class split is not.

R55's per-class table showed no >100% cell and is not obviously affected, but it was produced
by the same two-agent mechanism, so treat its per-class rates as **suspect pending a
consistency check** rather than as verified. The arena's class effect is unaffected — it was
computed from hand-labelled traps, not from this ledger.

**Fix before any future per-class claim:** have ONE pass assign the class, or reconcile the
two and report the disagreement rate. This is a coverage-denominator defect of exactly the
kind `feedback_validator_coverage_denominator` warns about.

**What actually predicts defect density is PRIOR AUDIT EXPOSURE — not locus, not doc type:**

```
R55  3 MOST-audited hub docs     498 claims   5.6%   (prose-key basis)
R58  3 stale hub docs            595 claims   7.7%
R60  module_34,   never audited  114 claims  32.5%
R60  carbon_balance, never audited 210 claims 31.9%
```

Two docs of completely different kinds, both never depth-audited, land within 0.6 points of
each other and 4-6x above the audited hubs. **Attention is the variable. Everything else
tested so far is not.**

> **SHARPENED 2026-08-02 (second-reader review), two ways.** (1) *Every* row of this table
> was receiving its **first** depth audit at measurement time — the only docs ever
> depth-audited are R55's, R58's and R60's own targets. What varies across the gradient is
> cumulative *ordinary* attention (Q&A rounds, checkers, notes-file corrections), which is

> "attention" is the right word, but it is not an exposure a depth-audit sweep

> class) vs carbon_balance's 1.0%; reweighting R55's per-class rates to carbon_balance's mix
> predicts 7.2%, not 5.6% (`audit/tools/second_reader_reanalysis_2026_08_02.py` — a bound,
> not a measurement: it uses R55's SUSPECT per-class rates). The gradient survives
> standardization (~2.8x), but "4-6x" is partly composition.

## The defect gradient — the session's main empirical result

```
R55  3 MOST-audited hub docs    498 claims  28 confirmed   5.6%    1 Critical
R58  3 stale hub docs           595 claims  46 confirmed   7.7%    7 Criticals
R60  module_34, NEVER audited   114 claims  22-37         19-32%   6 Criticals
```

**Measured density is a function of audit ATTENTION, not of centrality.** A hub result is a
FLOOR. The instrument had the opposite premise hard-coded ("hubs are an UPPER-BOUND sample")
until it was removed on 2026-08-02 — see `doc_depth_audit.workflow.js` measurePrompt.

Corpus surface, measured: **46 module docs / 48,259 lines**, 7 cross_module / 5,330, 7
core_docs / 3,273, 30 helpers+reference / 12,757. **Only 7 of 46 module docs (15%) have ever
been depth-audited** — R55 (10/52/56), R58 (11/29/70), R60 (34). Thirty-nine never have.

There is no defensible corpus-wide point estimate, and producing one would repeat the 9.52
error. What is defensible: the floor is ~6%, the one cold-doc measurement is 3-5x that, and
85% of the corpus sits in the unmeasured cold region.

## THE OPEN DECISION: corpus-maintenance vs. scaffolding-first

**Recommendation on the evidence: scaffolding-first.** Mike is deciding; do not act on this
without him. Four independent lines converge:

1. **The highest-defect classes are the most mechanizable.** `attribution_read` 23.7%,
   `set_membership` 15.9% — against `mechanism` 2.5% and `citation` 1.1%. Attribution is
   exactly what `scripts/check_attribution_omissions.py --dump-rolemap` derives
   deterministically from code at ~0 FNR. The class carrying the most harm needs no prose.
   *[2026-08-02 review: the rates quoted here are the SUSPECT R55 per-class table; and
   "~0 FNR" is the role MAP's fidelity, not the pipeline's — R60 found attribution defects
   the checker battery demonstrably did not prevent, because BINDING prose claims to the map
   (coverage) is the hard part (the analogous citation checker covers 43.8%). The strong form
   of this line is: GENERATION from the map deletes the binding problem that checking cannot
   solve. That form survives; the rates do not carry it.]*
2. **The corpus matters most where it cannot be checked.** Arena 1A: docs-only propagation
   29.2% vs 3.1% normal (p=0.0157). With code access the model self-corrects.
3. **The cost curve does not converge.** Measured 2026-08-02: **$30/doc, 1.13M tokens.** A
   full sweep is ~$1,400 and decays with every MAgPIE merge; after ~60 rounds coverage is 15%.
   *[2026-08-02 review: "decays with every merge" is the load-bearing premise here, and the
   measured durability evidence cuts against FAST decay — R59 arm A re-probed R58's fixes and
   they held (0 Criticals in ~720 rewritten lines), and once-attended-but-stale hubs sit at
   7.7%, near the 5.6% floor rather than the ~20% cold level. Decay speed is a lead to
   measure, not a premise to assume.]*
4. **R58's structural finding**: the machine-checkable surface is already clean and defects
   migrated to prose synthesis — M29's auditor found a per-claim audit of
   `equations.gms`/`declarations.gms`/`input.gms` would catch **zero** of that round's
   Criticals. The residual lives in the layer scaffolding would not have.

**Strongest counter, and it partly dissolves:** cross-module interconnection is what users
most need and what a per-file index does not naturally produce — but the role map IS that
graph, mechanically derived. What genuinely remains is narrative (why a cycle exists, what
breaks if you touch it), which is real and small.

**What would change the recommendation:** a refuted cross_module rate materially BELOW the
module rate would mean curated synthesis docs hold up better than per-module prose.

## Next actions, cheapest first

1. **3 refuters over already-cached cross_module lens results.** Answers the locus question
   and is the cheapest thing left. Resume with the FULL args payload plus
   `resumeFromRunId` — a resume does NOT restore args, and does NOT guarantee cache replay
   (both cost real money on 2026-08-02; size any block by its worst case).
2. **Scaffolding pilot**: generate module docs' interface sections FROM the role map, which
   deletes the highest-defect class instead of re-auditing it at $30/doc forever.
3. **Sweep the 9.52 residue**: 41 mentions remain in the corpus, while `AGENT.md` documents
   it as the canonical unmeasured number.

---

**Written 2026-08-01. Supersedes the ordering in `other_falsehoods_mining_plan.md`,
which remains the detailed spec for track 2.** Every gate and threshold here is fixed
*before* the corresponding run.

**Amended 2026-08-01 evening, before Sprint X dispatch — no Sprint X data existed when
these changes were made.** Four changes, all from re-deriving the R55 artifact rather than
re-reading the prior summary of it: (1) shares replaced by **rates per claim**, which
halves the apparent process signal; (2) the R55 per-class numerators are **pre-dedup** and
the top of that table is inflated — R55's own verification pass had already retired the
double count; (3) the **lens ablation is replaced** by a battery-vs-LLM diff, because 26 of
28 R55 findings were single-lens and the ablation was therefore near-vacuous; (4) the
Critical census is recorded, along with the rubric property that makes it **partly
definitional** and disqualifies it as a decision variable.

## The reordering, and what caused it

The 2026-08-01 session fixed 25 doc defects. **Every one was a pointer error** — a
citation pointing at the wrong line, or a path naming the wrong realization. Every
checker built that day binds a pointer. Then a free re-analysis of R55's depth audit
(`audit/integrated/depth_residual_density.json`, 3 hub docs, 5 decorrelated lenses, every
Critical/Major adversarially refuted) put that layer in proportion:

```
                share of defects        rate per claim        of 8 Crit+Major
POINTER          1 / 27    3.7%          1 / 89    1.1%             0
BINDABLE FACT   21 / 27   77.8%         21 / 221   9.5%             6
PROCESS          5 / 27   18.5%          5 / 128   3.9%             2
```

**Pointer errors are ~4% of confirmed defects and zero of the serious ones.** A day of
work had been spent hardening the layer that carries almost none of the harm. (Lead, not
result: n=27, one round, the most-audited hub docs, and the lens set determines what is
found. The 1-item gap against 28 reported confirmed is unreconciled and flagged.)

**The rate column was added 2026-08-01 and it moves the conclusion.** The share column
divides by *findings*; the rate column divides by *claims of that kind*, which is the
denominator that exists. On shares, PROCESS looks 5x the pointer layer. On rates it is
3.5x — same direction, half the size — and BINDABLE dominates on both. **Any threshold
stated as a share of findings is measuring how many claims of each kind the doc happens to
make, not how wrong they are.** The pre-registered rules in this plan were rewritten on
that basis (see *Pre-registered decision rules*).

Per class, from the same artifact:

```
attribution_read       9 / 38   23.7%    the only Critical + 3 of 7 Majors
set_membership         7 / 44   15.9%
attribution_populate   3 / 28   10.7%
data_flow_direction    3 / 47    6.4%
formula                2 / 50    4.0%
mechanism              2 / 81    2.5%
citation               1 / 89    1.1%    largest claim class, lowest yield
attribution_declare    0 / 22 | default_value 0 / 36 | realization 0 / 3 | other 1 / 60
                      ----------------
TOTAL                 28 / 498   5.6%
```

⚠️ **These numerators are PRE-DEDUP and the top of the table is inflated.** R55's own
verification pass retired a double count that this JSON still carries:
`round55_depth/MEASUREMENT.md:65-79` merges M52 bugs 1/5/10 into one defect ("three views
of one defect" at `module_52.md:458`) and merges M52-4 with M56-7 (one code fact, two doc
sites). Deduped, the attribution numerator is **2 events, not 4**, on a Crit+Major basis —
so `attribution_read` sits somewhere in **5.3%-23.7%**, not at 23.7%. The five Minors in
that class were never dedup-audited.

**What survives the dedup is the ORDERING, not the magnitudes.** Even the floor of the
attribution range is ~5x the citation class, and `citation` is untouched by the merge (it
had one finding). What does NOT survive is any point estimate: MEASUREMENT.md §2.4 already
recorded that a rate built on 2 events has a Poisson 95% CI of roughly [0.27, 8.2] per 100
and "cannot discriminate against a ~2 per 100 bar". Carry the range or carry nothing.

⚠️ **Third caveat, found 2026-08-01 during R60 setup: R55's attribution findings were
produced against a role map with 26 known defects.** The role map is the code-derived
ground truth every lens agent is told to check FIRST for any DECLARED/POPULATED/READ claim
(`doc_depth_audit.workflow.js` ROLEMAP_CLAUSE, billed as "~0-FNR on this class"). It was
regenerated for R60, and the delta was decomposed:

```
CHECKER effect  (same SHA 0d7ebeb90, R55 checker vs current):  26 vars differ
CODE    effect  (same checker, 0d7ebeb90 vs 2c02843ec):         0 vars differ
```

**All of it is checker improvement; MAgPIE's interface topology did not move at all.**
Mostly 13 `fm_*` vars plus `pm_climate_class` that R55's map carried as
`declared_in: None`, and several wrong `populated_by` entries. The old map was *blanker*,
which biases toward reporting omissions that were not omissions.

**9 of R55's 28 findings — including 3 of the 7 Majors — name a variable the map had wrong
at the time.** Six of those are attribution-class, i.e. half the attribution findings.
The Critical is **not** among them (`pm_carbon_density_secdforest_ac_uncalib` was mapped
correctly), so it stands on this axis.

This downranks confidence; it does not void the findings — the map is a first reference
that agents must confirm with a both-endpoints grep, and the Majors survived adversarial
refutation. But stacked on the dedup caveat, **R55 is no longer a clean baseline for the
attribution classes.** R60's within-module arm, drawn at random against the corrected map,
becomes the first clean within-module baseline this project has, and should be quoted as
the comparator rather than R55 once it exists.

At the same time, the arena's only two significant effects both point the same way:

```
class = attribution_role   28.1%  vs  4.2% all other classes   p = 0.0012
regime = docs-only         29.2%  vs  3.1% normal              p = 0.0157
```

**Attribution-role IS a cross-module claim** — who declares vs. populates vs. reads a
variable across module boundaries. The class effect and the process layer are the same
finding reached from two directions, and nothing else in the arena exceeds ~4%.

## The Critical census, and why it proves less than it looks

Classified 2026-08-01 by reading every Critical in the last three rounds that ran an
adversarial LLM doc audit — **R55** (depth-first, most-audited hubs), **R58** (open-ended
taxonomy, stale hubs), **R59** (split QA; both its Criticals are *latent*, rubric §1.5).
R56 was mechanization-only and R57 was instrument integrity; neither graded findings.

**10 Criticals across 3 rounds. All 10 are structural — wrong module topology, a
fabricated entity, or wrong mechanism semantics. None is a pointer error.**

| round | n | what they are |
|---|---:|---|
| R55 | 1 | `module_52.md:458` consumer set {29,32}; true {14,29,32,35} |
| R58 | 7 | M11-F3/F4 (urban costs → M10, cropland costs → M30; both wrong owner, while the doc's own machine-checkable catalog was correct) · M11-F5 (`vm_cost_trade_feasibility` claimed fixed at 0 in `selfsuff_reduced_bilateral22`; live equation there) · M29-F1 (`pm_carbon_density_soilc` exists nowhere and is the closing arrow of a **fabricated feedback loop**) · M29-F9 ("Provides To" names 5 + a hedge; true set ≈11, M22 arrow reversed) · M70-F1 (`vm_feed_balanceflow` documented "internal"; M71's *default* realization reads it twice) · M70-F3 (M36 missing from the `vm_cost_prod_livst` consumer set; the 70→36→70 cycle is real and unlisted) |
| R59 | 2 | `module_70_notes.md` asserts M70 *reads* `vm_costs_additional_mon`, in the entry written to prevent that misattribution · `module_52.md` never received R58's `stockType` correction (`m_carbon_stock_ac` as additive sum vs. mutually-exclusive dispatch) |

Under a stricter reading — the reader's *causal* model is wrong, not just an edge
misassigned — it is 6 of 10 (M29-F1, M29-F9, M70-F1, M70-F3, M11-F5, stockType).

**⚠️ It is substantially definitional, and must never be quoted without this.**
`flywheel_rubric.md:18-27` lists nine Critical triggers; seven are topology / existence /
mechanism-shaped, and **citation drift is routed to Major by fiat** (`:40-41`), off-by-few
to Minor (`:56`). A pointer error *cannot reach Critical* under this rubric. So "0 of the
Criticals were pointer errors" is closer to a rubric property than a discovery — **and
that weakens the "0 of 8 Criticals+Majors" line above for its Critical half.** (The Major
half is empirical: citation drift IS an explicit Major trigger and none of R55's 7 Majors
was one.)

The residual empirical content is thin but real: two Critical triggers are value-shaped
(inverted Boolean default; mechanism claimed active when off by default) and **none of the
10 fired on those**. Also mine, single-pass, n=10, by a classifier who already knew this
plan's thesis. Treat as a lead.

**What it does license for Sprint X:** the harm concentrates in *interface attribution* —
who reads what, in which direction, whether the edge exists at all. All 10 Criticals are
that. `attribution_read` (5.3%-23.7%) and the arena's `attribution_role` (28.1%) are the
same class measured by two instruments that share no code.

---

# TRACK 1 (lead) — Sprint X: cross-module claims, docs-only

Absorbs and supersedes "Sprint P" as originally drafted. Not yet run.

## The question

Do the docs mislead a reader about **how MAgPIE works across module boundaries** — and if
so, how often, per claim?

## Why docs-only is the whole measurement, not a detail

Run normally (strong model, tools on), this flywheel would measure **3.1%**, because the
model self-corrects from source. The result would look like validation and would say
almost nothing about the docs.

**Docs-only converts a model measurement into a corpus measurement.** It is also the
regime closest to colleagues on weaker models — the population the corpus exists for.
Keep a small normal-regime control cell so the regime gap is re-measured rather than
assumed from arena round 1A.

## Design

| axis | levels | why |
|---|---|---|
| **claim locus** | cross-module vs within-module | **both arms, or the concentration is assumed rather than measured** |
| **regime** | docs-only (main) + normal (control cell) | isolates corpus from model capability |
| **lens** | all 5 from `doc_depth_audit.workflow.js`, reported per lens | a lens is an ENTRY POINT, not a taxonomy — see below |

1. **Exhaustive claim ledger first.** `cross_module/` is 5,330 lines over 6 substantive
   docs (safety guide, circular dependencies, 4 balance docs) — small enough to enumerate
   every load-bearing claim, so rates carry real denominators rather than estimates.
2. **Within-module arm** sampled at RANDOM, not by centrality. R55 and R58 both ran on
   hubs and R58 found its own selection survivorship-biased; hub residual density is a
   floor, not an estimate.
3. **Trace every propagated error back to the doc claim that caused it.** A flywheel
   measures whether a reader is misled — the outcome, which is what matters — but without
   tracing it reports that a miss happened, not which claim to fix. Same gap that keeps
   the 261 unactionable.
4. **Report the two axes separately: lens (entry point) and class (what the defect is).**
   They do not agree, and conflating them is what made the original ablation design wrong.
   R55 per lens (a finding may be credited to more than one):

   ```
   mechanism_direction   8 findings   Crit 1, Maj 1     highest-yield lens
   declare_populate      7            Crit 1, Maj 1
   config_realization    7            Maj 2, Info 1
   consumer_read         5            Crit 1, Maj 1
   citation_formula      5            Maj 2             but 3 of its 5 were attribution_read
   ```

   `mechanism` is the second-*cleanest* class (2.5%) while `mechanism_direction` is the
   highest-yield *lens*. Both are true: the lens brief tells the agent to open both
   endpoints and walk causal direction, so it finds attribution, set-membership and
   formula defects — not "mechanism" defects. Symmetrically, **the pointer lens is mostly
   a delivery vehicle for non-pointer findings** (3 of 5). That is the sharpest available
   statement of what the deterministic battery lacks: not a process lens, **the traversal**.
   A checker that validates a citation finds citation drift; an agent that *walks* the
   citation to its endpoint finds the attribution error at the other end.

5. **ABLATION REPLACED — the pre-registered lens ablation is near-vacuous.** In R55, **26
   of 28 findings were credited to exactly ONE lens**; only 2 had multi-lens overlap. With
   near-zero redundancy, dropping lens L loses ~exactly L's findings, so the ablation
   re-reports the per-lens counts and resolves nothing. The per-lens spread (5-8 findings)
   is inside Poisson noise anyway.

   **Run instead: a battery-vs-LLM diff on the same claim ledger.** Execute the standing
   deterministic checkers over the identical docs and set-difference their findings against
   the lens agents'. That answers the question the ablation was *for* ("what is the standing
   battery blind to?") directly, costs no model calls on the battery side, and yields a
   per-class blind-spot map instead of a single number. Keep the per-lens report as a
   descriptive byproduct, not as an arm.

   Recorded as a rejected option, with its reason, so the next session does not re-derive it.

6. **Adversarially refute every Critical/Major** before counting, as R55 did. Process
   claims are the most confabulation-prone to audit precisely because they need reasoning.

7. **Dedup before any rate is quoted.** R55's headline artifact still carries a double
   count its own verification pass retired (three views of one defect at one doc line).
   One defect = one code fact, however many doc sites or lenses surfaced it. Report
   `findings`, `distinct defects`, and `doc sites` as three separate numbers.

## Reuse, do not rebuild

`audit/tools/doc_depth_audit.workflow.js` already builds a per-claim ledger with a
coverage denominator (`total_checkable`) and already runs the 5 lenses
(`workflow.js:71-75`). The semantic flywheel (`/validate-semantic`) already exists. This
is a targeted variant, not new machinery.

It already records `bug_class` and `lenses` per finding (`workflow.js:108-111,342`) and
already dedups — but **on the wrong key, and at the wrong scope**, which is exactly why
R55's retired double count is still live in the JSON:

```
workflow.js:251-253   normClaim(b) = doc_line :: first 80 chars of claim text, lowercased
workflow.js:277-287   dedup is PER DOC, across lenses
```

Two failure modes follow directly, and both are the ones MEASUREMENT.md retired by hand:

- **Same defect, different phrasings, same doc line.** M52 bugs 1/5/10 are one defect at
  `module_52.md:458`; the claim strings differ, so three keys survive. Keying on claim
  *text* cannot collapse them.
- **Same code fact, two doc sites, two docs.** M52-4 ≅ M56-7 is one parallel-not-serial
  error verified from both ends. The dedup is per-doc, so a cross-doc duplicate is
  **structurally uncatchable** — no amount of key tuning reaches it.

**Fix before dispatch (small, and it is the difference between a rate and an artifact):**
key on the *code fact* — `file_evidence` normalized to file+identifier, plus `bug_class` —
not on claim prose; and run a second dedup pass **across docs** after the per-doc one.
Then emit `findings`, `distinct defects` and `doc sites` as three separate counts, because
they are three different numbers and only the middle one belongs in a rate.

## Pre-registered decision rules

**Rewritten 2026-08-01, before any Sprint X data exists.** The prior rules were stated as
*shares of findings* ("PROCESS > 20%"); a share divides by the finding count, so it moves
when the doc simply makes more claims of one kind. All rules below are **defect rate per
claim of that class, with an interval**, and the interval is part of the rule.

**Power first, so a null is interpretable.** At a ~6% corpus rate, an exhaustive
`cross_module/` ledger yielding ~500 claims produces ~30 findings. Split three ways that
is ~1-20 events per layer; the Poisson 95% CI on 6 events is roughly [2.2, 13.1], i.e.
7%-44% of 30. **A share-based 5%-vs-20% threshold is not decidable at this n — the old
rules could not have fired correctly in either direction.** Rates fix this because the
denominator is claims (hundreds), not findings (tens).

- **Decide on the interval, never the point.** A rule fires only if the 95% interval
  excludes the threshold. If it straddles, the recorded result is **UNDECIDED at this n**,
  with the n needed to decide it. That is a real outcome and must be reported as one, not
  rounded to the nearer branch. (`MEASUREMENT.md:88-90` is the anchor: "a label on a
  threshold-straddling number ... flips under any reasonable re-count".)
- **PROCESS rate ≤ pointer rate (both ~1-2 / 100 claims), interval-separated from
  BINDABLE** → pointer/fact mechanization was the right investment. Stop. *(This is what
  R55 actually shows once rates replace shares: PROCESS 3.9% vs POINTER 1.1% vs BINDABLE
  9.5%.)*
- **PROCESS rate reaches BINDABLE's, or carries Criticals that survive refutation** → the
  battery addresses the minority layer and the docs-only 29.2% has a mechanism. Process
  becomes top priority; the answer is an LLM-audit cadence, not more checkers.
- **BINDABLE FACT dominates by rate (the R55 signal — and the Critical census points the
  same way)** → the expected result. Highest-value work is neither extreme: finish the
  role-map / set-index mechanization, which is partly built. **Prioritise by class within
  it: `attribution_read` first** (the only class carrying Criticals in both R55 and the
  arena), then `set_membership`.
- **Cross-module ≈ within-module** → the locus hypothesis is wrong, a real result worth
  recording; re-target on class (`attribution_role`) instead of locus.
- **Battery-vs-LLM diff finds the battery blind in classes it nominally covers** →
  the problem is checker FNR, not coverage. `check_consumer_attribution` is the standing
  suspect: R58 measured it the *worst* checker at 74.8% mutation survival despite being
  retrofitted first. Fixing an existing checker beats adding an LLM cadence.

**A Critical count is a weak instrument here and is not a decision variable.** The rubric
makes pointer errors ineligible for Critical by construction, so "Criticals are structural"
cannot discriminate between hypotheses. Report Criticals; decide on rates.

## Cost

~40-60 agents, ~15-20M tokens, ~1 window. The ablation subset is dropped; the
battery-vs-LLM diff that replaces it costs no model calls, so the freed budget goes to the
claim ledger — which is where the denominators come from, and denominators are what the
rewritten decision rules run on.

# TRACK 2 — the 261 other-falsehood candidates

Full spec: **`audit/other_falsehoods_mining_plan.md`** (pre-registered, unchanged).

**Re-scoped 2026-08-01 after the reordering:**

- **Tier 0 — RUN IT, it is free.** No model calls. Dedup (261 → 219), route by shape to
  existing checkers, then the mechanical doc-trace on confirmed items. Also yields a
  **grader-vs-checker agreement number** on items both saw — the cheapest calibration
  available anywhere in this project, and worth having on its own.
- **Tier 1 — DEPRIORITISED, now gated.** Run only if Tier 0's **non-citation tail**
  surfaces something. Rationale: the pool is ~77% citation drift by crude routing, i.e.
  mostly the pointer layer now measured at ~4% of real defects. Hand-adjudicating 20 LLM
  claims about *answers* is a weaker use of a window than measuring the corpus layer that
  carries the harm.
- **Tiers 2-3 — unchanged, still NOT AUTHORISED**, gates intact.

# Standing traps (apply to both tracks)

- **Sample from CLAIMS, not FINDINGS**, when estimating an unmeasured class. A findings
  pool measures what the instruments look for, and process errors are by definition the
  class no instrument binds. R57 recorded this as survivorship.
- **A crash is not a clean run.** `check_gams_citations_impl` raised IndexError on every
  benchmark invocation (needs a positional argv the harness never passed) and its zero
  findings read as a blind spot for a full round.
- **A benchmark seeded with cases your new detector was built for measures the seed
  list.** Report the pre-existing rate separately (41%, not the 57% headline).
- **Verify a RANDOM stratified sample before quoting any rate.** Hand-picked 6/6 implied
  ~100% where a random sample gave 57-67%; a 10-item eyeball put a class at "dominant"
  where the census put it at 0.9%.
- **Adjudicate at the tool's own offset**, never by re-searching its string — that lands
  on a different occurrence and you review text the tool never flagged.
- **Report per class, never pooled.** Today's citation checker had a 100% class and a 20%
  class side by side; the average described neither.
- **A share of findings is not a rate.** Dividing by the finding count measures how many
  claims of each kind the doc makes, not how wrong they are. Always divide by the claims of
  that class. This flipped the apparent size of the process signal by 2x.
- **Re-derive from the artifact, not from the prior summary of the artifact.** The
  pre-dedup inflation, the near-vacuous ablation and the lens-vs-class conflation all
  survived a full session inside a summary that read as settled, and all three fell out of
  one pass over `depth_residual_density.json` and `MEASUREMENT.md`. A summary carries the
  conclusions and drops the caveats that would have qualified them.
- **A lens is an entry point; a class is what the defect is.** They are different axes and
  they disagree. `mechanism_direction` is the highest-yield lens and `mechanism` is nearly
  the lowest-yield class, simultaneously and without contradiction.
- **Check whether a severity tier can even express the hypothesis before testing it on
  severity.** The rubric routes pointer errors away from Critical by fiat, so "Criticals
  are structural" was ~unfalsifiable. Read the rubric's triggers before using its tiers as
  evidence.
